Dear Editor and Reviewers,

Please find attached our revised paper for "Ten Simple Rules for Making Research Software More Robust". We have taken all reviewer comments into account in this revision and have produced a stronger paper. Each of the reviewer's concerns is addressed in-line below. Attached is also a version of the document with changes highlighted in orange.

Thank you and best regards,

Greg Wilson & Morgan Taschuk

Thanks for the feedback. We have clarified and condensed our definition of 'robust' software in the introduction, and have made version control a full rule.

We've promoted documentation to a full rule by merging the README and Usage rules into one and explicitly mentioning other types of documentation with appropriate references.

Thanks for the feedback. We are focusing mostly on software that is preparing to be published or otherwise distributed, and so discussing the details of program flow and execution are out of scope. We do mention other good software engineering practices, such as source control, testing, and versioning as an introductory taste of software engineering.

We've added more mention of reproducibility and citations to posts written by C. Titus Brown and by GaÃ«l Varoquaux.

These two rules have been combined.

We consider usage to be part of the documentation, but a section of this rule referred to checking input parameters and echoing out parameters to the command line. These sections have been moved to the rules on controlling common operations and producing identical results.

We think it's important too, but it's a tough sell in some crowds. Version control is its own rule now, and we've added a reference to another educational article, "A Quick Introduction to Version Control with Git and GitHub".

We've re-written this section more mindful of the package manager rule to follow and more explicitly pushing back against using external executables and services. We also include web services now for consideration.

We believe we have addressed the discrepencies between these two rules with our re-write.

With the increasing torrent of 'big data', more and more calculations are outsourced into high performance compute clusters or cloud environments. When spawning jobs across tens to thousands of machines that may or may not share any storage, and likely only gives their users privileges in their own space, a requirement for needing root to install a package severely limits its reuse and distribution. Other people without administrative access to their machines are also cut off from using such software. Mostly, we've been bitten by this often enough to feel strongly that it should be its own rule.

If you call external services, then according to the (new!) guideline in "Reuse software", that software should itself be robust and therefore produce the same results on every run. Some services are updated to change, add or remove data or results and this is unfortunate, but expected. Two subsequent runs of the software, barring any other changes, should still produce identical results.

In addition, software that doesn't produce identical results is much more difficult to test. Depending on the amount of variation, it can be nearly impossible.

We merged all mentions of documentation into the first rule.

With the other changes, this section has been removed.


> Reviewer 3
> 
> Comments to the author:
> 
> This paper sets out to describe 10 simple rules which, if applied, can contribute to making software research more robust. It provides a useful set of guidelines that should generally improve the robustness of research software and it should be of interest to most graduate students who are writing software in the process of their research.
> 
> I recommend the publication of this paper but would request the addition or additional emphasis on one point which is not called out as a rule but which is mentioned in passing in several places within the paper. In particular I am referring to the recommendation to put all software into a source control system. As this is an opinion paper, I do not think this is a necessary change for publication (in my opinion itâs a vital rule, that is just my opinion) but it is referenced in several places and in particular the authorâs definition of ârobust softwareâ includes â...is kept under version controlâ. As this is an issue frequently ignored or addressed âtoo lateâ by graduate students I would like to see this get additional emphasis, even if it is not promoted to being a full rule.

We added Rule #1, which is version control.

> The remainder of my comments are meant to provide (hopefully) useful feedback to the authors in the line of suggestions that may enhance the manuscript.
> 
> In describing successful software research projects the authors state â...who have adopted strong software engineering approaches, have high standards of reproducibility, use good testing practices, and foster inter-institutional collaborations that grow into strong user basesâ.. All of these points can be clearly tied to their rules with the exception of the final statement about inter-institutional collaborations. While such collaborations are desirable, particularly to establish project continuity and longevity, they are not strictly necessary for robustness and this is not further referenced in the manuscript.

We removed this line from the text.

> In several cases, it seems that the paper might violate the first rule of âThe 10 simple rules for writing a 10 simple rules paperâ (http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003858) with multiple rules combined into a single rule.

We reviewed all the sections you mentioned. In general, we believe that most of our *bolded* sections within each rule are refinements of the rule and not separate rules. We address each one of your concerns in-line below.

> For example rule 8 combines putting parameters on the command line with echoing all parameters to the log file to support reproducibility and provenance. 

We've moved these recommendations around so that they fit better into their major rule than they did before.

> Similarly rule 5 covers both automating the build process and automating the deployment and installation. 

We've clarified this section to focus mostly on build automation and dependency acquisition.

> Rule 4 also tends to stuff multiple rules (bolded) into one rule (( limit dependencies, ensure dependencies are available) these 2 are closely related), with â use native functionsâ which is a very different idea and not what I would expect from a âreuseâ rule. 

We removed this last 'native functions' rule and replaced it with a more appropriate discussion of robust dependencies.

> Finally the âWhat we left outâ section implicitly defines an additional rule (documentation). In this particular case there could have been a single rule (Document your code and usage) that could encompass the points of both Rules 1 and 2 (Readme, usage) as well as the points from âWhat we left outâ.

We combined all mentions of documentation into a single rule.

> In rule 8, I would tend to suggest generalizing the rule somewhat to suggest externalizing parameters rather than necessarily requiring them to be available as command line options. For example if a configuration file is used to provide all parameter values, this could accomplish the task of separating the parameters out from the code as well as providing a record of the values used for a run as they describe through echoing parameters to a log file.

This section has been re-written to take your concerns into account.

Thank you again for your time and effort.
